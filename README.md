Score Keeper App
This is a simple score keeping application that allows you to track the score of a game for two players, referred to as "Home" and "Guest". The app also has the ability to save the current scores and reset the counters to zero.

Features
Increment the Home score by 1, 2, or 3 points using the "Plus One", "Plus Two", or "Plus Three" buttons.
Increment the Guest score by 1, 2, or 3 points using the "Guest Plus One", "Guest Plus Two", or "Guest Plus Three" buttons.
Save the current scores and reset the counters to zero using the "Save" button.
Usage
To use the app, simply click on the desired button to increment the score for the corresponding player. To save the current scores and reset the counters to zero, click the "Save" button.

Code Structure
The code is divided into several functions that handle the different actions of the app:

plusOne(), plusTwo(), and plusThree() increment the Home score by 1, 2, or 3 points, respectively.
guestPlusOne(), guestPlusTwo(), and guestPlusThree() increment the Guest score by 1, 2, or 3 points, respectively.
saveClick() saves the current scores and resets the counters to zero.
The code also includes variables for storing the current scores and the saved scores, as well as DOM elements for displaying the scores on the page.
